This mod adds the MNT computer and a wool wall decoration with the MNT logo.
It also adds the components that the computer is made of.

Some of the code is dependent on certain mineclone2 mods, so most of the functionality would likely break without mineclone2 active. It would still be possible to spawn the items.

To install this mod simply unzip the mntreform file and move it into the mods directory of your minetest version.

You can contact the developer Li0n for any reasons on irc or through email.
